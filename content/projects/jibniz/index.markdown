**jibniz** is a javascript implementation of the IBNIZ virtual machine.
IBNIZ is an esoteric stack-based programming language created by _, in which almost every
instruction is one character long. The code is intended to be ran for each
pixel on a 256x256 screen, at every frame, thus making it possible to produce
animations.
