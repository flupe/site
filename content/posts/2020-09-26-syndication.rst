title: Syndication for the greater good
description: Where I setup an Atom feed
---

I stumbled upon Matt Webb's `About Feeds <https://aboutfeeds.com/>`_ and
realized I had been missing out on the power of web syndication for quite some
time. Turns out most sites still make their feed available in one way or
another. This allows anyone to subscribe to the content they are interested in
without having to rely on a centralized platform. No more checking out one's
twitter feed to see if they published a new piece, you get notified in due time
automatically.

One reason I never used RSS feeds before was that I never quite found the
right newsreader app, one able to sync between devices, open-sourced and
self-hostable. But then I discovered `miniflux
<https://https://miniflux.app/>`_. I've now setup an instance over at
`miniflux.acatalepsie.fr <https://miniflux.acatalepsie.fr>`_, running on the
same RPi that hosts my site. There's even `an Android app
<https://github.com/ConstantinCezB/Microflux>`_. What a world.

The next logical step was to setup a feed for my site itself, which I did *just
now*. You can find the link in the footer of this site. It's only the bare
minimum as it only shows blog entries --- more to come.

The takeaway is: do take the time to download a newsreader app and subscribe to
feeds, it will be worth your while. Now, onto making blog posts which are not
about the blog itself.
